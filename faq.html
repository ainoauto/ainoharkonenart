		<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

		<h1>What kind of paint do you use?</h1>
		<p> It depends. I don't have any specific brands that I use, and most of my paints are inexpensive. I wouldn't recommend the cheapest ones though, since they tend to not be of as good quality as some of the more expensive ones.</p>
		<h1>What did you use to make "insert artwork here"? </h1>
		<p>I use oils, aquarelles and acryls for paintings, and regular pencils and charcoal for drawings.</p>
		<h1>How long does it take to make a painting?</h1>
		<p>It depends on the size and on the motive. I'd say on average it takes anywhere from half an hour to 20 hours to finish something.</p>
		<h1>Can you draw me/my mom/my friend/someone else?</h1>
		<p>Most likely not. I usually don't do portraits.</p>
		<h1>Why not?</h1>
		<p>Painting specific people or someone's pet requires the skill to get every single detail just right. It's very hard and unless you actually are good at it, it never turns out looking like the motive. Never. Seriously.</p>
		<h1>Well can you draw "insert some other motive or idea"?</h1>
		<p>Yes I can! Send me a message and we'll figure something out.</p>
		<h1>Where can I send a message?</h1>
		<p>You can send me an email to the adress info (at) ainoharkonenart.com</p>
		<h1>Can I buy prints of your work?</h1>
		<p>Yes you can!</p>
		<h1>How much do they cost?</h1>
		<p>Prints are always cheaper than the original. The price depends on the size of the print, on what kind of material it's printed on etc.</p>
		<h1>Is it possible to buy the original instead of prints?</h1>
		<p>Yes it is. Message me if you find something you like!</p>
